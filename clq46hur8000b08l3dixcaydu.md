**Disclaimer**: Please use these responses as a last resort if you tried the questions several times and still couldn't pass it.

**1\. In the penny game exercise, why do you think it takes longer for one person to flip five batches of two pennies then one batch of ten pennies?**

`You have less collaboration on one large batch of work`

**2.¬†How does the Pareto principle apply to product development?**

`Often 80% of your product's value comes from 20% of your efforts`

**3.¬† Your team has been working on a software project for over a year. The software is behind schedule, so the executives have pressured the managers to try an agile approach. The manager for your team says that there are three project milestones coming up in the next six months. So the manager suggests that they simply rename the three milestones Sprint 1, Sprint 2 and Sprint 3. What's the biggest challenge with this approach?**

`It's unlikely that your team will get any benefit from an agile mindset by following existing practices`

**4\. What does it mean when you say that Scrum separates the "what" from the "how?"**

`The product owner decides what the team will deliver, and the team decides how they'll deliver it`

**5.¬†You work as a software developer on an agile team. Your manager has decided that the team must work off the existing requirements documents. What's one of the main challenges with this approach?**

`Agile teams embrace change, requirement documents are designed to limit conversation and flexibility`

**6.¬†Your agile team only has one database developer. So the other developers finish their tasks and then wait for their work to be Integrated into the database. This creates a backup for the database developer. But it also means that the other developers must either wait or add to a growing pile of database work. What's one possible solution to this challenge?**

`Have the database developer train the rest of the team so there are fewer handoffs`

**7\. What does it mean that Scrum defines itself as a "framework for empirical process control?"**

`It means that Scrum teams are encouraged to run experiments to improve the product`

**8.¬†What is typically not part of the product owner's role?**

`They create the project requirements documentation`

**9\. What's the best definition of a product iteration?**

`It is an incremental step towards delivering your product`

**10.The business analysts at your organization often take weeks to come up with an updated set of requirements. So the senior developer for your team encourages everyone to catch up on their training while they wait for the update. If you were an agile coach for the organization, what might you do to improve the situation?**

`You would encourage someone from the business to sit with the team to eliminate the handoff`

**11\. In the Agile Manifesto Principles 3 and 7 recommend continuous software delivery in "weeks" as a measure of progress. What's one of the ways an agile team can follow this principle?**

`Deliver software in two-weeks iterations or "Sprints"`

**12.¬†Your agile team has a senior developer that's been with the organization for over a decade. Whenever something goes wrong with the product, the director pulls this person out of the team to fix the trouble. What's likely to happen on your agile team when this person is pulled from their tasks?**

`Agile teams work in close collaboration, so this will likely create a backup`

**13\. The director of your software product development team has started a new initiative that emphasizes organizational knowledge sharing. So they purchased licenses for a social group chat platform. They asked you to keep the platform open to answer questions that are relevant to the product. Why might this be difficult for your agile team?**

`The platform will encourage your team to multitask`

**14.¬†How are organizational silos related to the penny game?**

`Organizational silos encouraged individuals to create large batches of work`

**15\. When working with an agile team, managers will often give up long term plans for predictability. So why are agile teams more predictable?**

`Agile teams commit to delivering product increments every two weeks`

**16.¬†Your agile team has set up a task board with a list of user stories under the "To Do" column. the Scrum Master says that the team can pull out the cards in any order that they like. So the developers start working on user stories that they think will be completed quickly. Is the Scrum Master right?**

`No, the agile team should always work on the highest priority user stories first`

**17\. What is not a characteristic of a self-organized team?**

`These teams have a director who assigns everyone their tasks`

**18\. What's one of the best ways to avoid the challenges with the cone of uncertainty?**

`Don't make all your decisions at the beginning when you know the least about the final product`
