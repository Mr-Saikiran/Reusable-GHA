First of all Memory leak is not sweeping Unused objects, It is Sweeping referenced objects.

### Definition:

**Memory leak** is a common memory issue that can result in an OutOfMemory error.  
In Java, memory leaks can occur even with automatic Garbage Collection (GC).  
GC removes objects that are no longer referenced.

However, if an object is not used but still referenced, GC will not remove it, potentially causing memory leaks in the JVM.

### Conclusion:

Understanding memory leaks in the Java JVM is crucial for maintaining optimal application performance. Despite Java's automatic Garbage Collection, memory leaks can still occur when objects that are no longer needed remain referenced. This can lead to an OutOfMemory error, causing the application to crash or behave unpredictably. By identifying and addressing these leaks, developers can ensure more efficient memory usage and improve the stability and reliability of their Java applications.
